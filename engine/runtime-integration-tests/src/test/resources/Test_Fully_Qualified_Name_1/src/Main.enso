## We only export A_Type, such that it can be imported and used from other
   projects with something like:
     import local.Test_Fully_Qualified_Name_1
     main = Test_Fully_Qualified_Name_1.A_Type

   or:
     from local.Test_Fully_Qualified_Name_1 import A_Type
     main = A_Type

   But we also have to ensure that it can be accessed via physical path:
     import local.Test_Fully_Qualified_Name_1
     main = Test_Fully_Qualified_Name_1.Synthetic_Mod.A_Mod.A_Type

export project.Synthetic_Mod.A_Mod.A_Type
export project.Synthetic_Mod.A_Mod.static_method
