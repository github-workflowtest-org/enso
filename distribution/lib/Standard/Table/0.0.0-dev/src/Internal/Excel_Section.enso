    ## Gets the data from a specific sheet.

       Arguments:
       - sheet: The sheet number or name.
       - headers: Specifies if the first row contains the  column names. If set
         to `Detect_Headers`, the process tries to infer if headers are
         present. If the column names are not unique, numeric suffixes will be
         appended to disambiguate them.
       - skip_rows: The number of rows to skip before reading the data.
       - row_limit: The maximum number of rows to read. If set to `Nothing`, all
         rows are read.
    Worksheet (sheet:(Integer|Text)=1) (headers:Headers=Headers.Detect_Headers) (skip_rows:Integer=0) (row_limit:(Integer|Nothing)=Nothing)

    ## Gets a specific range (taking either a defined name or external style
       address) from the workbook.
       If it is a single cell, it will be treated as the top left cell and will
       expand right and down to cover the connected cells.

       Arguments:
       - address: A name of a range or an Excel-style address (e.g. Sheet1!A1:B2).
       - headers: Specifies if the first row contains the  column names. If set
         to `Detect_Headers`, the process tries to infer if headers are
         present. If the column names are not unique, numeric suffixes will be
         appended to disambiguate them.
       - skip_rows: The number of rows to skip before reading the data.
       - row_limit: The maximum number of rows to read. If set to `Nothing`, all
         rows are read.
    Cell_Range (address:(Text|Excel_Range)) (headers:Headers=Headers.Detect_Headers) (skip_rows:Integer=0) (row_limit:(Integer|Nothing)=Nothing)
