/**
 * Widget edit handler.
 *
 * This handler takes an extended interaction and allows cooperation between parent/child
 * interactions. A usage example is WidgetSelection, which wants to open when the child is edited
 * and filters entries by edited temporary value.
 *
 * Widget's edit state should be manipulated by `start`, `end` and `cancel` methods; they will set
 * proper interaction in the global {@link InteractionHandler} and call the additional callbacks in
 * {@link WidgetEditHooks} passed during construction.
 *
 * The parent widget may pass its edit handler to one or more children's {@link WidgetInput} to
 * bound their interactions; when this child is edited, the parent is also considered edited,
 * along with any further ancestors. In particular:
 * - Starting, ending and cancelling (including automatic canceling by the global interaction
 *   handler) of child edit will also call proper callbacks in parent.
 * - Cancelling or ending parent edit will cancel/end the child's interaction.
 * - `isActive` method of both edit handlers will return true.
 *
 * This `edited` state is propagated only upwards: if only parent is edited, its children are not
 * considered edited. If child starts being edited while parent is still edited, the parent interaction
 * will be considered cancelled and then immediately started again. Similarly, when a parent's handler
 * is bound to two children, and one of them starts editing while the other is edited, the parent
 * will receive `cancel` feedback from the latter and then `start` from the former.
 *
 * **The `pointerdown` handler is a special case:** it acts as a capture-mode event handler; it is called on
 * the top-most widget, and a widget may choose to delegate to its child (if any) by returning false.
