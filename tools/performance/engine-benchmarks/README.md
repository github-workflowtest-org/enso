# Engine benchmarks

This directory contains a python script `bench_download.py` for downloading
Engine and stdlib benchmark results from GitHub, and `Engine_Benchs` Enso
project for analysing the downloaded data.

Note that for convenience, there is `bench_tool` directory that is a Python
package. The `bench_download.py` script uses this package.

To run all the Python tests for that package, run `python -m unittest` in this
directory.

Dependencies for `bench_download.py`:

- python >= 3.7
- `pandas` and `jinja2`
  - Install, e.g., by `pip install pandas jinja2`
- GH CLI utility
  - Install either from https://cli.github.com/ or with
    `sudo apt-get install gh`

Check `bench_download -h` for documentation and usage. Ensure that your
`/usr/bin/env python` links to Python version at least 3.7. `bench_download.py`
creates `generated_site` directory with HTML files for visualizing the benchmark
results.

One can also download only a CSV file representing all the selected benchmark
results with `bench_download.py --create-csv`.
